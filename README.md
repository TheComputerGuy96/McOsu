An unofficial open-source client for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) with the main focus on making practicing easier and customizing gameplay. If you have never played osu! before then I do not recommend using this client, as there are no gameplay tutorials in here.

Runs on McEngine: [https://github.com/TheComputerGuy96/McEngine](https://github.com/TheComputerGuy96/McEngine)

Binaries will be available for **Linux** and **Android** (more platforms if I can build them on Linux).

## Notable features which osu! doesn't have (yet) in comparison:
- Virtual Reality support (HTC Vive + Oculus Rift)
- Mid-play empty section skipping
- Beatmap scrubbing (CTRL + ALT + Click drag)
- Override CS/AR/HP/OD
- Speed/BPM changer
- Change mods while playing
- Actually useful target practice mod
- Experimental mods (Wobble, First Person, Minimize, Playfield flipping, Jigsaw, etc.)
- Properly drawn playfield border
- Arbitrary HUD scale (Combo counter, accuracy, etc.)
- Enable/Disable approach circles, numbers, sliderendcircles, followpoints or any other element
- Ignore beatmap sample volume
- Enhanced hit error bar, shows misaims and extra clicks
- Nearly unlimited customizability using console commands for people who want to tinker with everything (e.g. osu_playfield_rotation, osu_circle_fade_out_time, osu_skip_time, etc.)

## System Requirements:
- GPU with OpenGL ES 2.0+ support (on Linux)
- Android 6.0+ and GPU with OpenGL ES 2.0+ support (on Android; minimum version may change)
- GPU with OpenGL 3.0+ support (on macOS and Windows; might switch to ANGLE later)
